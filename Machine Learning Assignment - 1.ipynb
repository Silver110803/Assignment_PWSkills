    "Unsupervised learning can be effectively used in anomaly detection by allowing the algorithm to learn the normal patterns or behaviors within a dataset and then identifying data points that deviate significantly from these patterns as anomalies.\n",

If a data point does not fit well within the learned patterns, it is considered an anomaly or outlier. The degree of deviation from the norm can be quantified and used to rank anomalies by their severity.\n",
