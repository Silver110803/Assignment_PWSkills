    "Abstraction in OOP refers to the concept of hiding complex implementation details and showing only the essential features of an object. It focuses on providing a simplified view of an object's functionality, making it easier to understand and use. Abstraction is achieved by defining interfaces, abstract classes, or base classes that outline the essential methods and properties, while the actual implementation is hidden from the user.\n"
